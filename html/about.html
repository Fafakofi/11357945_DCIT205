          This is the Information Technology age and at its core is Computer Science. The study of computer science is therefore critical if <br> society is to take full advantage of the benefits Information Technology has to offer and make rapid economic advances. Computer <br> science involves the study and development of applications that allow for our everyday use of computers, the software systems that <br> support these applications, and the means and methods used to produce both applications and systems that behave reliably,<br> correctly and ethically. At the heart of Computer Science lies the skill of computer programming and employers who hire Computer <br> Scientists expect adept programmers with knowledge of current techniques and tools and the ability to apply sound engineering <br> principles to the development, construction and maintenance of computer programs. <br>

        <article class="about-article1">The range of courses available in the department and the skills acquired by students enable them to find employment in many <br> diverse fields of the economy and prepare our graduates for the computing industry, working in a project team (or research and <br> development team), and to enable the graduate to bring specialist skills to that team. The course also provides the platform for <br> further study or research through exposure to established and emerging technologies and methods, and to active fields of research <br> in Computer Science. </article>
        <article class="about-article2">The Department offers two undergraduate degree programmes, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Single-Major (3:2:1:1) and <br>Major-Minor (3:2:2:1) as well as Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.</article>
